        <h1>About Myself</h1>
    </header>

    <p>My name is Tim Frazier, and I am a web enthusiest living in Kanas City, MO.  Programming became my favorvite hobby when I was around twelve years of age.  I didn&rsquo;t have a teacher when I was starting out, but I had a strong desire to learn; I was facinated by the thought of how software / web applications worked.</p>

    <p>Luckily, I grew up in the years of the Internet, being born in 1988.  Fueling my thirst by reading a massive amounts of articles and tutorials was extremely satisfying &ndash; Java was the language I chose to start with.  Almost immediately, I knew I had found my new favorite hobby.  I was making a computer think!  I had always enjoyed solving puzzles and math problems, so it felt perfect.</p>

    <p>Though, to be honest, Java was a rough start for me at that age.  I came back to the language at a later date, but one day, after becomming  slightly discouraged, I randomly decided to look into how websites were built.  HTML/CSS, though not programming languages, were a much more graceful and forgiving entrance into the world of computer languages.  At this point, I had developed an odd addiction &ndash; The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. </p>

    <p>I quickly became bored of simple mark-up, and wanted to give &ldquo;coding&rdquo; another shot &ndash; This time, JavaScript was my choice.  I wanted to be able to enhance the pages I was learning to mark-up.  After I started getting the hang of that, I wanted to get into server-side programming so I could read/write from databases and generate pages.  As the first server-side language to learn, my choice was PHP as it was open-source (which also means free), and that was a great thing for a 14 year-old boy!</p>

    <p>To keep this breif, and skip beyond my remaining High School years, I graduated from DeVry University with a B.A. in Computer Information Systems (with a concentration in Information Security) in 2009.</p>

    <p>Now, almost ten years after picking up PHP, it is still my favorite server-side language, and one of my favorite past times. Although,  I still enjoy picking up new languages and staying current with the latest trends and technologies on a continual basis.</p>

    <p>Currently, The languages that I am proficient in include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Ruby <span class="faded">(and Ruby on Rails)</span></li>
        <li>JavaScript <span class="faded">(with or with out libraries)</span></li>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, I am very familiar with these libraries / pieces of software:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>jQuery <span class="faded">(JavaScript Library)</span></li>
        <li>Prototype <span class="faded">(JavaScript Library)</span></li>

        <li>Git <span class="faded">(Version Control System)</span></li>
        <li>SVN <span class="faded">(Version Control System)</span></li>
        <li>Magento <span class="faded">(PHP <abbr title="Entity-Attribute-Value (Database design structure)">EAV</abbr> E-Commerce Framework)</span></li>
        <li>Joomla <span class="faded">(PHP <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>)</span></li>
        <li>WordPress <span class="faded">(PHP <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>)</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>And these databases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>Oracle</li>
        <li>PosgreSQL</li>
        <li>SyBase</li>
        <li>DBF</li>
        <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
        <li>Microsoft Access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have also had a decent amount of experience with these languages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>ActionScript</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In my free time, when I&rsquo;m not researching or programming, I love to go for runs with my dog, ride my motorcycle, play guitar, and spend time with great friends that I have been fortunate to meet over these years.</p>
